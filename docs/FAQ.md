## üéØ Basic Usage

### Q: How do I see my watch history?
**A:** Click the extension icon in your browser's toolbar (looks like a play button). You'll see tabs for:
- **Videos**: Your regular YouTube videos
- **Shorts**: YouTube Shorts you've watched
- **Playlists**: Playlists you've discovered

1. Refresh the YouTube page
2. Make sure you're on youtube.com (not youtube.tv)
3. Check that the extension is enabled

**Note:** These overlays are fully customizable! You can change the text, colors, and size in Settings.

### Q: How does the progress bar work?
**A:** The extension saves your position every 5 seconds. When you return to a video, you'll see:
- A small progress bar showing how much you've watched
- The exact time you stopped (like "5:30 (45%)")
