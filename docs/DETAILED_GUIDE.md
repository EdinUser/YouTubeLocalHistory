# 📖 Complete User Guide for YT re:Watch

*A step-by-step guide to master your YouTube viewing experience*

---

## 🚀 Quick Start (5 Minutes)

### Step 1: Install the Extension

**For Chrome Users:**
1. Visit the [Chrome Web Store page](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/local-youtube-video-histo/pebiokefjgdbfnkolmblaaladkmpilba)
2. Click "Add to Chrome" 
3. Click "Add Extension" when prompted
4. You'll see the YT re:Watch icon appear in your browser toolbar

**For Firefox Users:**
1. Visit the [Firefox Add-ons page](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/yt-rewatch/)
2. Click "Add to Firefox"
3. Click "Add" when prompted
4. You'll see the YT re:Watch icon appear in your browser toolbar

### Step 2: Start Using YouTube Anonymously
1. Go to [youtube.com](https://youtube.com)
2. **No need to log in** - browse YouTube without an account
3. Start watching any video
4. Watch for at least 10 seconds
5. That's it! You're getting history tracking without Google surveillance

### 🔄 **Bonus: Account Independence**
**Here's the amazing part:** Your history works the same whether you:
- Use no YouTube account at all
- Switch between different YouTube accounts (work/personal)
- Log out and back in with different accounts
- Share the computer with family members

**Your viewing progress stays consistent across ALL situations!** 🎉

### ⚠️ **Privacy Reality Check**
**This extension only handles YouTube history data.** For broader privacy protection, you also need:
- **VPN** (hide your IP address)
- **Ad blocker** (block tracking scripts)
- **Privacy browser** (Firefox with strict settings, or Brave)

YT re:Watch stops YouTube from getting your viewing progress data, but Google still knows you visited their site.

### Step 3: View Your History
1. Click the YT re:Watch icon in your browser toolbar
2. You'll see your watched videos with progress indicators
3. Explore the different tabs to see all features
