# YouTube Local History

If you are like me and don't want to provide your YouTube history to Google, but still want to us it, this TamperMonkey/GreaseMonkey is for you!

First, turn off YouTube History by going to your Google profile, then select "Data & Privacy", scroll a little down, select "YouTube History" and select "Pause" to stop it. Keep in mind that if you also delete all of your history, you will have empty home screen, so you might want to keep the records and not purge them. Or you can purge them, activate the history, watch a single clip and pause it again.

Then follow the instructions below:
